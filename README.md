### Coordinate Markings Guide

<ul>
<li>Diamond Plate themed background: This is an undiscovered area and can be attacked.</li>
<li>Red background: A ship has been hit here.</li>
<li>White background: A previous attempted attack has missed here.</li>
<li>Grey (only visible on your ships): Your automatically generated ship pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The computer AI is smart it will randomly attack coordinates till it hits a ship. After will continue to guess adjacent squares to try to find the rest of the ship.
